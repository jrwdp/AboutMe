I am a Veteran of the United States Coast Guard, I served for just over 10 years
and have sailed pretty much the entire caribbean. I was an Electronics Technician,
meaning I worked on Radios, Radars and Navigational computer systems. I was also
a Tier 2 admin for the high and low side of the DOD network when stationed on a
ship. Now I live here and my wife is stationed here, we plan to stay. I am currently
looking for employment, probably in the development sector maybe something in DevOps.
Which is why I am working on learning Java as well, people tend to want that on the
resume...
