I am a Veteran of the United States Coast Guard, I served for just over 10 years
and have sailed pretty much the entire caribbean. I was an Electronics Technician,
meaning I worked on Radios, Radars and Navigational computer systems. I was also
a Tier 2 admin for the high and low side of the DOD network when stationed on a
ship. Now we live here and we plan to stay. I am currently looking for employment, 
probably in the development sector maybe something in DevOps. Which is why I am 
working on learning Java as well, people tend to want that on the resume...
